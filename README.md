# Introduction to GitHub and Git

GitHub is an open source repository that encourages team collaboration, peer review, and version tracking.  It is a great way to store and share your research.  In addition to securing your research in a remote location, it allows others to reproduce your research or even suggest improvements. 

Like many programs, there are multiple ways to do the same tasks.  Git is simply a way to access GitHub on your own computer.  You can manage your repository and do many of the same functions with either GitHub or Git/GitBash.  

The following are goals of this week's tutorial:  
  
**DAY ONE:**

- Part 1: Using GitHub  
- Part 2: Using Git and GitBash  
  
**DAY TWO:**
